### An implementation of Java 8's Optional&lt;T> using RxJava2 & Java 7

Wraps `Maybe` with an an API that mimics Java 8's optionals with some functional flavor added in.

Note: 1.0.0 is probably the final, stable release as I've moved on to Kotlin for the most part.

gradle:
`compile 'com.carterhudson.tools:rxoptional:1.0.0'`
